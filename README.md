•  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client was The Gaming Room. Their game, Draw It of Lose It, currently runs on Android OS and they want to expand to multiple platforms—such as iOS, and desktop environments. They want cross platform functionality in which up to thousands of players on various clients can all play concurrently. It was decided that this would be achieved by using the client-server architecture with a Linux-based server-side application.
  
•  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Studying the client-server architecture so that I could incorporate it into my design is something I feel I did particularly well.

•  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document established the framework and functionality goals of the software. This allowed me to begin writing structured, organized, and purposeful code from the start.

•  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the requirements and constraints section. Now that I have finished the document and studied the client-server architecture along with the strengths and weaknesses of various operating platforms, I could elaborate on both the requirements and constraints of Draw It of Lose It.

•  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needed a cross-platform game with responsive real-time performance. This allowed them to play the game on their personal profiles via various clients. For example, the user can seamlessly move between their phone or desktop PC using the same player profile. The entire software design was based on this need. Considering user’s needs, along with the client’s, is paramount in software design. By working to meet, or exceed, user needs, the development maximizes the value of the final product.

•  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

For this software, I studied various operating platforms—such as macOS, Linus, and Windows—along with various design and architectural patterns—such as the singleton pattern and client-server architecture. This helped me form a more comprehensive understanding of software design that greatly assisted with designing this project. Utilizing the client-server architecture is something that I will certainly be using in future software applications.
